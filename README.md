## Analysis of sales and profits of a retail company in 2022

This project involves analyzing the operations of a retail company that procures materials from factories and sells them to manufacturers. The pricing of the materials is determined by the negotiation between the salesperson and the manufacturer, with some salespeople opting for higher prices and lower sales volumes, while others choose lower prices and higher sales volumes.

The objective of this project is to answer the following questions:

1. Which employees generated the highest revenue for the company in 2022?
2. Which employees generated the highest profit for the company in 2022? Are they the same as those who generated the highest revenue?
3. Who deserves to receive the highest bonus at the end of the year?
4. What changes should be made to maximize the company's profit in the next year?

For the purposes of this project, the terms "employee," "salesperson," and "seller" are used interchangeably to refer to the individuals responsible for selling the materials to manufacturers. Please note that all names and amounts mentioned in this project have been changed to protect the privacy of the individuals and companies involved, although the overall trends and tendencies have been preserved.
